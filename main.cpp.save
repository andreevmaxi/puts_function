    '1' - means that this equation have only one root and it is in x1 variable.
    '2' - means that this equation have two roots in x1 and x2 variable respectively.
    '0' - means that this equation don't have any roots!
    'i' - means that this equation have infinite number of roots.}
    \param[in] a it's integer variable of head member(coefficient) of equation
    \param[in] b it's integer variable of second member(coefficient) of equation
    \param[in] c it's integer variable of free member(coefficient) of equation
    \param[out] x1 it's double variable which contains first root of input equation
